    "# Color mixing and optimization with the PumpBot\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second full color mixing exercise in the **AI-orchestrated self-driving labs** course. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will explore the software used to control your PumpBot. You will mix water colored with food coloring with the bots, visualize the output and run a simple optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise builds heavily on the *in silico* exercise you did in your first exercise. \n",
    "While you could have completed that exercise individually, you have to work as a group for this exercise. \n",
    "Only one of you can run the Python scripts on the robot at a time, so you should all try to run the robot at some point. \n",
    "If not today, then one of the other robot days. \n",
    "Communication, sharing of results, and screen sharing of the running code will be important. \n",
    "There might be some wait time during this exercise. \n",
    "You can enjoy the sight of the PumpBot working and keep an eye on it to make sure it behaves as intended. \n",
    "You can also get started with or work more on your group report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Should you fail to finish this exercise within the time frame, there will be a chance to catch up later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3.1: Get started with PumpController\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can start mixing some colors in the real world. Similar to before, we import the `PumpController` class and a few extra functions helping us to connect to the PumpBot. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the different classes and methods in the pump_controller module [here](https://www.student.dtu.dk/~s193903/47332/)."
